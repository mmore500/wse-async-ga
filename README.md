Development work for agent-based evolution/epidemiological modeling on the Cerebras Wafer-scale Engine (WSE) hardware.
Incoprorates [hereditary stratigraphy](https://github.com/mmore500/hstrat) methodology for distributed tracking of agent phylogenies.

Requires [Cerebras SDK](https://www.cerebras.net/developers/sdk-request/), available through invitation.

## Contents

- `cerebraslib`: port of `hsurf` algorithms to Cerebras Software Language (CSL) as well other supporting materials for WSE kernels
- `kernel-test-cerebraslib`: uses Cerebras WSE hardware simulator to run unit tests on `cerebraslib` components
- `kernel-async-ga`: general purpose framework for decentralized, island-model genetic algorithm across WSE Processing Elements (PEs), with configurably-sized agent genomes, customizable mutation operator, and customizable fitness function; includes scripts to run on Cerebras WSE hardware simulator
- `pylib`: Python support code for data analysis

## Installation and Running

See our [Continuous Integration config](https://github.com/mmore500/wse-async-ga/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yaml) for detailed instructions on installing dependencies and running project components.

Note that the `test-csl` continuous integration components do not run within the scope of the public-facing `wse-async-ga` repository in order to protect Cerebras' intellectual property.
